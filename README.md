# Selenium Python Automation Framework
# Project Overview

This project is a Selenium Python Automation Framework designed for UI automation using Python. It follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern and uses PyTest for test execution. HTML reports are generated for test results.

# Tech Stack

•	Python 3

•	Selenium WebDriver

•	PyTest

•	Page Object Model (POM)

•	pytest-html (for reports)



# Framework Highlights

•	Modular design using Page Object Model

•	PyTest-based execution with reusable fixtures

•	Explicit waits for reliable element interaction

•	HTML reporting for test results

•	Easy-to-extend structure for new test cases



# Project Structure

Folder/File	Description

# Pages

# BasePage

•	open(url) – Opens a URL

•	find(locator) – Waits for element presence

•	click(locator) – Waits and clicks element

•	type(locator, text) – Clears and types text
